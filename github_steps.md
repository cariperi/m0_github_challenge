# GitHub Steps

To establish a connection between a local repo and a remote repo, first make sure you have set up a local repo on your own machine and a GitHub repo under your own account.

Then, navigate to the GitHub repo for the project in your browser. Follow the directions to push an existing repo from the command line (copy the 3 lines of code). Run these three lines in your terminal.

## A few helpful tips:
1. Make sure "SSH" is selected in the new GitHub repo before running the code to connect the local and remote repos.

2. Make sure you have created a file in your local directory, and initialized Git with the `git init` command.

3. Make sure to save your work in your editor as you go before staging changes with `git add "file name"` and refresh your browser after `git push` to see your changes.
